The animosity was palpable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So I joined this Zoom call for the draft,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and people lashed out at me. &lsquo;Rich, your texts are annoying,&rsquo; said one commish. &lsquo;SO annoying,&rsquo; chirped an East Coast manager. &lsquo;So fecking annoying,&rsquo; squeaked someone else. Did we even have an Irish guy in the league? &lsquo;What about me?&rsquo; peeped another little man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He continues, &ldquo;&lsquo;Ohhh, I have to pay ten cents for each text.

These folks should have a good long look in the mirror.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they did, they would see the eye-popping stats of a true champion, assuming they had a browser window open to ESPN on their laptop, and assuming said laptop was located somewhere in the reflection of the mirror. Never mind that Tuggin on Tuggles scored 8th in points overall, they allowed 2nd fewest points overall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always had a defense-first approach,&rdquo; says Uncle Rikky. &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;Bend, don&rsquo;t break.&rsquo; All that shit.&rdquo; He suddenly becomes impatient. &ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t have time to get technical with laymen. You can score all the points in the world, but if you let the other team score 158 on you, you&rsquo;re looking at an early playoff exit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know a lot about fantasy football,&rdquo; I say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Der Fuhrer just nods.

But your tight end SUCKS!&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh wow, whatsie-what, your team is really nice and balanced! You&rsquo;re gonna do so well this year!&rsquo; These are, like, the best managers in the game, so naturally, I was curious to hear what their razor-sharp fantasy minds had to say. But&hellip; they never got to my team, they just skipped over it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I said, drawing on my inhaler.

I think, Why not? I&rsquo;ve never done it before, because my name is Seth Wickersham, but how bad could it be? He mumbles something about wanting to meet Cousin Sal and asks if I can introduce him. When I ask why, he looks at me like I&rsquo;m an idiot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Uncle Rikky, he&rsquo;s Cousin Sal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Suddenly time and space have been disrupted, and we are at Beshock Ramen in SD&rsquo;s East Village and I am eating eel.

It&rsquo;s a redneck Coyote Ugly. I didn&rsquo;t really want to shroom &ndash; I am Seth Wickersham, after all &ndash; but it was hard to say no when Uncle Rikky insisted they would enhance the flavor of my shoyu ramen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps I get a little too deep when I ask, &ldquo;What do you think future generations will say about Tuggin on Tuggles?

Without my astute investigative instincts, there is no Seth Wickersham. So I follow him into the lobby, and I eavesdrop from behind a fake cactus. Or is it real? I can&rsquo;t tell. At first, I think it&rsquo;s fake, but when I grab hold of it, real needles seem to penetrate my hand, and real blood seems to run down my arm. Will have to investigate further, or my name is not Seth Wickersham!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Uncle Rikky is quite animated, chewing on a toothpick &ndash; such a Double Deuce thing to do! &ldquo;Yes, I think he bought the whole story!&rdquo; he says into his phone. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s even eaten all the shrooms and edibles. Haha, what a SUCKER!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Could he really be saying such things? Or is this just fantasy? I stand up, in a daze, and stumble out from the cacti. I hear voices now &ndash; a barrage of questions. </span><span class="c4 c8">Who is Der Fuhrer? Who is Seth Wickersham? WHAT is Seth Wickersham? What is your brand, Seth Wickersham? WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING BRAND?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My foot catches on a cactus branch, and I trip and fall forward.

I have a headache like I&rsquo;ve never felt before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if on cue, I get a text from Uncle Rikky: &ldquo;This story is starting to confuse me.

No blood. No cactus quills. No bumps or bruises. Looking back on this fateful night, I cannot be sure what was said, nor with what conviction &ndash; if any. Despite all this, I have no doubt that I was in the presence of greatness.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&ndash;Seth Wickersham, San Diego, January 2, 2023</span></p></body></html>
